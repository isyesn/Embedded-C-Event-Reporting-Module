# Embedded-C-Event-Reporting-Module
The objective of this project is to develop an event reporting module in Embedded C, addressing non-nominal situations, generating event reports, and distinguishing between different event severities.
### Test Scenario:
The `main.c` file includes a simple test scenario demonstrating the generation of an event report. Customize and expand this file as needed for your specific use case.

### Documentation:
Refer to the comments within the code for detailed explanations of the implemented logic and design decisions.

## Additional Notes

- The code adheres to the coding standards specified in [AD-01] ESC-HR-ST-001 SW Coding Standard.
- For any questions or clarifications, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for the opportunity to complete this test project. I look forward to discussing it further.
